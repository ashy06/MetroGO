# MetroGO
Metro application is for users who wish to avail the metro facilities in many places of India. The approximate amount of routes available, 
approximate cost, online booking, past bookings and much more. 
Through the displayed routes, the user gets a clear-cut information 
about the stations the metro passes through and where the user tends to travel. Based on users request it is possible to proceed to ticket 
booking and users details are thus stored in the database from where ticket details can be obtained. The main intention of this application is to reduce the queue at ticket counters and customer care helpline. This also initiates the digital campaign where there is no need to get a 
printed ticket or buy a metro card and store money in it, this user 
interface portal needs just an active internet connection for surfing 
through routes, intermediate stations and prices for each ticket in the application.
